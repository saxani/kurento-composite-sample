Kurento JavaScript Tutorial: WebRTC group composite  call.

Running this tutorial
---------------------

In order to run this tutorial, please read the following instructions.

git clone https://github.com/srigaurav1986/KurentoExample.git   
cd KurentoExample   
npm install  
npm start  

If you have problems installing any of the dependencies, please remove them and clean the npm cache, and try to install them again:

rm -r node_modules  
npm cache clean  

Access the application connecting to the URL http://localhost:8080/ through a WebRTC capable browser (Chrome, Firefox).

Note

These instructions work only if Kurento Media Server is up and running in the same machine than the tutorial. 
Steps to run KMS 6.0 on Ubuntu 14.04 are :  

echo "deb http://ubuntu.kurento.org trusty kms6" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurento.list  
wget -O - http://ubuntu.kurento.org/kurento.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -  
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install kurento-media-server-6.0  

However, it is possible to locate the KMS in other machine simple adding the argument ws_uri to the npm execution command, as follows:

npm start -- --ws_uri=ws://kms_host:kms_host:kms_port/kurento
In this case you need to use npm version 2. To update it you can use this command:

sudo npm install npm -g
